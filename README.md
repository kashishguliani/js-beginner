The code you provided is creating a basic NFT (Non-Fungible Token) system using JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

The NFTs variable is an empty array that will store the NFT objects.

The mintNFT function takes several parameters (_name, _city, _age, _cloth, _clothColor) to create an NFT object. It assigns the parameter values to the corresponding properties of the NFT object and then pushes the object into the NFTs array. It also logs a message to the console indicating that the NFT has been minted.

The listNFTs function loops through the NFTs array and prints the metadata of each NFT object to the console. It displays the ID (index + 1), name, city, age, cloth, and cloth color of each NFT.

The getTotalSupply function logs the total number of NFTs minted (the length of the NFTs array) to the console.

The code calls the mintNFT function three times, passing different values for each NFT. Then it calls the listNFTs function to display the metadata of all minted NFTs. Finally, it calls the getTotalSupply function to print the total number of minted NFTs.
